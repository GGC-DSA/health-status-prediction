## Project Overview

**Project Description:**<br/>
Create an exploratory visual that is both engaging and informative to a user about Heart Diease based on selected symptoms!

**Project Goal:**<br/>
1. Create an ~~interactive~~ visual.
2. Show the correlation between the most common Heart Disease symptoms and their Heart Health Status.
