# TO-DO 
### This is a document that defines all of the features left unfiinished and/or features discussed with the client that were "not even started." 

Previously stated in our **Implemented Features** table, we did not get to initialize an interactive model like originally planned.

Additionally, the team was not able to create one of the visuals required to be done using D3.js. We encountered errors for which none of our debugging could solve. Below, I have included a screenshot of our most occuring error. I have also included a folder named `Visual Code` that contains our least-buggy files for the D3.js visualization.
